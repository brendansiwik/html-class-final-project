            <h1>About Project DIVA</h1>
            <p>You dear reader might have lots of questions about this such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>What is Project DIVA?</li>
                <li>Does this count as a hobby?</li>
                <li>Is this really the best thing you could think of for your final project?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Don't worry I will answer all of these questions and maybe more. I'll also make sure to answer them in the wrong order to bamboozle you</p>
            <h2>Does this count as a hobby</h2>
            <p class="p_textwrap">Maybe. I waste a lot of time playing these games so I think so. 
                                  I find them fun and that's what a hobby is supposed to be.</p>
            <h2>What is Project DIVA</h2>
            <p class="p_textwrap">Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA is a series of Japanese rhythm games 
               developed by Sega and Crypton Future Media. In the games symbols 
               appear on the screen correlating to a button on the controller 
               and matching ones fly in and you need to press the correct button 
               when the matching symbols overlap in time to the music.</p>
            <p class="p_textwrap">All the music in the games are vocaloid music from a large selection 
               of vocaloid creators sung by Hatsune Miku, Kagamine Rin and Len, 
               Megurine Luka, Kaito, and Meiko.</p>
            <p class="p_textwrap">The series started on the PSP in 2009 and consists 6 Main
               series games, 4 spin-off games for mobile and VR, and 2 Project Mirai Games on 
               the 3DS. The most recent game Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA Megamix (Mega 39s in Japan) 
               was released in 2019.</p>
            <h2>What's Vocaloid?</h2>
            <p class="p_textwrap">I'm not going to go too much into vocaloid itself I can make a whole site on that.
               The short version is that Vocaloid is a voice synthsesis program that is used to 
               create singing voices. There are numerous voices you can use and the voices all
               names and characters that go with them such as Hatsune Miku who is the most well
               known Vocaloid. There's more to it but that's all you need to know for this.</p>
            <h2>Is this really the best thing you could think of for your final project?</h2>
            <p>Yes</p>
