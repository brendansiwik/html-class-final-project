                            nearly as good as the later games 4/10</li>

                        <li class="opinion_list_content">Was just DIVA 2nd rereleased with some extra content. Still has
                            the unrefined gameplay of the original and is still not in English
                            without fan translation patches 3/10</li>

                <li class="opinion_list_item">Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA F
                    <ul>
                        <li class="opinion_list_content">This is where the series gets good. The gameplay was much improved
                            from the original PSP games. The timing works much better and the
                            game just feels like everything is going faster which with rhythm
                            games quick gameplay is great. Also had an online mode where people
                            could create their own charts with custom music for others to play
                            fantastic and lots of fun 8/10</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li class="opinion_list_item">Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA Arcade Future Tone
                        <ul>
                            <li class="opinion_list_content">Changed the gameplay completely by adding a touch slider that you have
                                to swipe on in certain directions for notes and added having to press   
                                multiple buttons at once. It also has over 200 songs. It is only officially
                                available in arcades but because thsese arcade machines run Windows it is
                                possible to run the game on standard PCs through a program called 
                                <a href="https://github.com/PDModdingCommunity/PD-Loader/wiki/2)-Installation">PD Loader</a>. Because it can be played on PC and be easily modded with 
                                custom songs, charts, and other stuff it is the best way to 
                                play the game to me 10/10</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li class="opinion_list_content">Refined the gameplay slightly from F and improved the timing a bit
                            so hitting buttons at the right time was a bit easier. Had better songs
                            than F and still had the fantastic online edit mode 9/10</li>

                <li class="opinion_list_item">Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA X
                    <ul>
                        <li class="opinion_list_content">X is ehh. It was the last game to use the old gameplay from before
                            AFT (Arcade Future Tone). It was also the last DIVA game on the
                            PS Vita. It also went for a different style with a story mode that
                            was not too good. Although it had all these weak points it had some
                            of the best songs ever in the series and none of them have ever been
                            added into later games 6.5/10</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li class="opinion_list_content">Just a port of AFT to the PS4 but because it isn't on PC it can't be
                            easily modded 8/10</li>
                    </ul>

                    <ul>
                        <li class="opinion_list_content">Port of Future Tone to the switch but they cut out half the songs and
                            added like 20 new ones. To make up for removing half the game they added
                            a new gamemode with motion controls that is pretty fun but a lot of people
                            don't like it. It's the only way to play a Project DIVA game in the Future
                            Tone style of gameplay portably 7/10</li>
