            <h1>Home</h1>
            <p class="p_textwrap">Hello and welcome to my final project 
                                for my class on HTML and web design. 
                                This site is going to talk about the 
                                Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA series 
                                because they are the best series 
                                of rhythm games . I am counting this 
                                as a hobby because I love this series 
                                a lot and spend way too much time playing 
                                these games.</p>
            <p class="p_textwrap">This site is only going to focus on the 
                                main series. I won't be touching on the 
                                Project Mirai games or the mobile spin-offs
                                or anything else (except maybe Miracle Girls
                                Festival) mainly because I haven't really
                                played them that much.</p>
            <p class="p_textwrap">This site has been a lot of fun to make. I put
                                a lot of work into this site. Partially because it's
                                the final project and I should do that but mostly
                                to show my love to the Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA
                                series because these games mean a lot to me and are
                                one of the few things that can always cheer me up
                                no matter what.</p>
            <p class="p_textwrap">Please watch the videos to your left to get an idea
                                on what these games are and enjoy reading about them
                                if you care. If you don't please try to enjoy all the
                                work I put into this site anyway.</p>
