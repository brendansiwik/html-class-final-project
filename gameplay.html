            <h1>Gameplay</h1>
            <p class="p_textwrap">The standard Project DIVA gameplay is that there are 4 
                                symblols, X, Square, Circle, and Triangle (The symbols 
                                for the 4 face buttons of a Playstation controller), 
                                that fly onto the screen onto matching black symbols 
                                and you press the corresponding button when the symbols overlap
                                to the beat of the music. You can also press the direction on the d-pad
                                that corresponds to the button on the other side of the controller.</p>
            <p class="p_textwrap">There are other symbols and mechanics that differ slightly between games
                                but in general there are 2 different categories for gameplay. There's
                                Future Tone and then there's everything else.</p>
            </p>
            <div class="left_side_div">
                <h1 style="text-align: center;">The Older Games</h1>
                <p>In all the games from the original Project DIVA to X along with the standard 4
                   symbols there are 4 arrow symbols and hold notes For the arrows you need to hit the direction on d-pad 
                   and it's matching symbol at the same time. The hold Notes appear as one of the 4 symbols
                   connected to a string and you have to hold the button down until the end of the string</p>
                <p>In F, F 2nd, and X they added star notes. For the star notes you have to flick one of
                   the analog sticks or on the PS Vita you can also swipe the touch screen. There are also double stars
                   where you have to hit both analog sticks at once.</p>

                       a low quality pdf of the manual (It was the official manual downloaded from Sega's website it
                       has no excuse to be this poor of quality)</p>

                <h1 style="text-align: center;">Future Tone</h1>
                <p>Arcade Future Tone and the games based off of it (Future Tone PS4 and Megamix) changed some things up from
                    how Project DIVA was in the older games. By some things I mean most things.
                    The stars, holds (kinda), and the arrows are gone.</p>

                <p>Arcade Future Tone added a touch sensitive bar called the touch slider which is used for slide notes.
                    with slide notes you swipe on the touch slider in the direction the note is pointing. also
                    added were multi notes and hold notes. With multi notes there are multiple symbols connected with a 
                    line and you need to press all the buttons shown at the same time. With multi slide notes you have to
                    swipe in both directions at the same time.</p>
